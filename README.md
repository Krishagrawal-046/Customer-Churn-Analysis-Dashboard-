**Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard**

**Overview:**
This project features an Excel-based dashboard designed to analyze customer churn in a telecommunications company. By processing raw customer data through Excel's built-in tools, the dashboard provides insights into churn trends, helping identify factors contributing to customer attrition and potential retention strategies. The analysis includes demographic breakdowns, churn rates by various categories, and visual representations to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
                                                                The dashboard was developed as part of a personal project to demonstrate data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills using Excel.
	
**Features:**

    Data Cleaning and ETL: Raw customer data is cleaned and transformed within Excel to ensure accuracy and usability. 
	Key Metrics: Displays total customers, new joiners, total churned customers, and overall churn rate.
    Breakdown Analysis: 
		->Churn by gender, age group, state, internet type, payment method, contract type, and tenure group.
        ->Top states with highest churn rates.
        ->Distribution of churn reasons (e.g., competitor offers, dissatisfaction, attitude issues).
    Visualizations: Interactive charts and tables to spot patterns, such as higher churn among fiber optic users or month-to-month contracts.
    Insights Section: Highlights actionable findings, like high-risk customer segments for targeted retention efforts.
			
**Dataset:**

	The dataset used in this project includes anonymized customer information such as:
	    Demographics (age, gender, state)
	    Service details (internet type, contract, payment method)
	    Usage metrics (tenure, monthly charges, total revenue)
	    Churn status and reasons
        The raw data sheet contains over 6,000 customer records. Summary tables and pivots are derived from this data for the dashboard.  
	**Note:** This project was inspired by online resources for learning Excel dashboard creation. The data is sample-based and not from a real company.

**How to Use:**

	1.	Download the Excel File: Clone this repository and open Customer-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard.xlsx in Microsoft Excel.
    2.	Navigate Sheets:
        	->DASHBOARD: Main interactive view with charts and key metrics.
    	    ->TABLES: Aggregated summaries and pivot tables.
    	    ->Raw Data: Original dataset for reference.
    3.	Interact with the Dashboard: Use slicers and filters to explore churn patterns by different dimensions.
    4.	Customization: Feel free to modify formulas, charts, or add new analyses in Excel.

**Key Insights from the Analysis:**

 	Overall Churn Rate: Approximately 27% of customers churned.
	High-Risk Groups:
    	->Fiber optic users have a churn rate of over 41%.
	    ->Month-to-month contracts show a 46.5% churn rate.
	    ->States like Jammu & Kashmir and Assam exhibit higher churn (57% and 38%, respectively).
    Common Churn Reasons: Competitors offering better devices or deals account for a significant portion of churn.
	Demographic Trends: Customers over 50 and those with shorter tenures are more likely to leave.
    These insights can guide strategies like improving service for high-churn groups or offering incentives for longer contracts.

**Technologies Used:**
    Microsoft Excel: For data processing, pivot tables, charts, and dashboard creation.
